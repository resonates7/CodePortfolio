These are Jupyter notebook projects from my classes from coursera.org. I've included a brief description of each project.

APPLIED DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON SPECIALIZATION
( https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python )


-Applied Machine Learning in Python Exams: I successfully passed these assignments to earn the certification in Applied Machine Learning with Python

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+1: I explored the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at 	regression and Part 2 will look at classification

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+2: I explored the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at regression and Part 2 will look at classification.

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+3: I trained several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based on info from Kaggle (credit card). TO DO: RESEARCH FAILURE TO CONVERGE ERRORS
