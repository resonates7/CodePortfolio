These are Jupyter notebook projects from a few of my classes from coursera.org. I've included a brief description of each project.

APPLIED DATA SCIENCE WITH PYTHON SPECIALIZATION
( https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python )


-Applied Machine Learning in Python Exams: This course explored various real-world case studies and applications of machine learning. I successfully passed these assignments to earn the certification.

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+1: I explored the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at 	regression and Part 2 will look at classification

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+2: I explored the relationship between model complexity and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of various supervised learning models. Part 1 of this assignment will look at regression and Part 2 will look at classification.

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+3: I trained several models and evaluate how effectively they predict instances of fraud using data based on info from Kaggle (credit card). TO DO: RESEARCH FAILURE TO CONVERGE ERRORS

-- Applied_ML_Assignment+4: This is a real life case study conducted by the University of Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS) were we partnered with the City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?
 



- Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python:Learned about data visualizations and data manipulation using Pandas DataFrames. It included design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations using Matplotlib.
